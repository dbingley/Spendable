		<h4>A free service provided by Spendable CIC, a a not-for-profit organisation [about&nbsp;us]</span></h4>
		<div>
		<p>We’re passionate about money, because money is for people the biggest cause of worry, stress, and relationship breakdown.</p>
		<p>Spendable is a not-for-profit organisation with a background in providing free advice to help people manage or resolve problem debt. But we thought there must be some service we could offer to make money easier for everyone, so that issues were less likely to build up.</p>
		<p>We had long conversations with over a thousand people to get to understand their money challenges, and what kind of service could help. People described that their spending decisions were for different time periods:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>People found it easiest to plan across a week for their food, shopping and going out</li>
			<li>Most bills were monthly</li>
			<li>Across the year there were some bigger planned-for or unexpected expenses which came up, like Christmas, breaks away, or car repair</li>
		</ul>
		<p>But people’s income didn’t come in at a time to make it easy to cover each of these time periods. Some were paid monthly, but found they were running short at the end of the month and that it was difficult to afford the bigger costs which came up through the year. Others received a few different smaller sources of income which came in at different times, and found it hard to know where they were.</p>
		<p>We asked what could help.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>The first thing people asked for help with managing their everyday spending on a weekly basis, so they could know how much they had available each week and still be able to cover their bills and have enough for future weeks.</li>
			<li>People wanted help managing their bills and subscriptions, because they often not really sure what they were paying, whether it was good value, and whether they could save money.</li>
			<li>Something to make it easier to afford bigger expenses or income dips coming up across the year, without paying interest on debt.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>We’ve started by focusing on developing a service to help with the first two areas above, but in the future we’ll also work on the third.</p>
